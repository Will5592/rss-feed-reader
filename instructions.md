**Instructions**

This app was developed using a local MAMP server/database

I have also included a live hosted version of the project on 000webhosting for ease of viewing - https://jadu-project-5592.000webhostapp.com/
The project files are included on a github repo -

**Note:** Errors are turned off on the hosted version of the site, but I've left them enabled locally.

In order to run on local machine:

1. Create new DB called 'rss_feeds'. ('Alternatively use any name and update DB name in app/classes/config/Database.php).
2. Import .sql file provived.
3. Set root folder in program such as MAMP to '/app'.
4. Navigate to localhost.

IN APP

1. Some example RSS have been included in the DB.
2. Navigate to the about page for further instructions on functionality of the APP.
